The program idea:

When you start working on a project, you will press the timer to alarm you once it's done.

The timer logic:

1. We have three buttons, each one point for specific minutes (1,10,25)
2. Press the minutes buttons then press 'Start' button so the
timer will start counting from that point
3. Once the time is zero, the alarm should work
4. If the user want to pause the timer, he can click on 'Pause' button to stop it temporary
5. The 'Stop' button is to stop the timer and the 'Reset' is to start again


Project Plan:
1. Write the user stories for the timer
2. Create repository on GitHub
3. Add some scenarios to start from
4. Write simple test cases to implement them in coding
5. Write javascript code to implement the timer
6. Build html and css page to the timer
